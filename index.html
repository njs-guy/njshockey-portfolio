        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Nick Shockey. I am a recent graduate from Kent State University with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. With about a 3.7 GPA, I was able to make the Dean’s List for most semesters. I am a hard worker that is currently looking for work in IT, programming, or software development. This e-portfolio will tell you about my professional goals, skills, and experience.</p>
        <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a software developer. However, I felt that I didn't know enough after graduation to achieve this goal. So, I went online and learned more skills such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. From there, I made a few open source projects to demonstrate those skills and tried to practice just about every day.</p>
