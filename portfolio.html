            <p>A random number generator that runs in browser (or desktop with Electron). While it is a standard number generator, the UI is much cleaner than most of the web-based generators that I’ve used.</p>

            <p>This program outputs a text file to let the user make an on-screen counter in OBS such as for deaths or resets. I found it to be a much easier and quicker solution than manually changing the text each time. The image to the left is the logo I designed for it.</p>

            <p>I have always loved computers, but I never had the money for a good one until the summer of 2019. Building a custom PC myself really let me see what all the parts do and how they all work together. The most surprising part about it was how relatively easy the whole thing was. The only issue I ran into was some incorrectly plugged cables, which I fixed easily. It has a 500GB SATA SSD, 2TB 7200 RPM HDD, Ryzen 5 2600X, Radeon RX 580 8GB, and 16 GB of RAM. Overall, I’m really happy with this build. It can play pretty much any game I throw at it in 1080p 60 FPS at ultra to max settings.</p>

            <p>The site you're reading right now was made with basic HTML and CSS! While I could have used a website maker (which I have used for resumes in the past), making one from scratch sounded more interesting and more fun. Since this is a basic document, I decided not to use any JavaScript or front-end libraries to keep the site simple and snappy. This site also uses royalty-free images from Pixabay and the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans/blob/main/OFL.txt" rel="external" target="_blank">Open Sans</a> and <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto/blob/main/LICENSE" rel="external" target="_blank">Roboto</a> fonts.</p>
